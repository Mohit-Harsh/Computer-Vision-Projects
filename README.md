### ðŸ§  Denoising of MRI Images using CNN

**A CNN-based Approach to Denoise MRI Scans**

The implementation of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for image denoising has been a key field for research in past 10 years. Current state of the art models have been implemented using Transformer and Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) concepts which have high hardware requirements and also require large amounts of data to train. Although they perform very well in controlled lab environment, they are not useful in many real life applications. To tackle the aforementioned problems we designed a Super Resolution Image Denoiser Network (SRIDNet) that demonstrates a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. It delivers competitive denoising results while maintaining a small model size and low computational cost, making it highly suitable for resource- constrained environments.
