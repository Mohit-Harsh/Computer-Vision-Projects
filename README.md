### ðŸ§  Denoising of MRI Images using CNN

**A CNN-based Approach to Denoise MRI Scans**

This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the blind denoising of brain MRI images. The model leverages two key blocks: a **SuperResolution** module to upscale images and a **Denoiser** to enhance image quality while restoring the original dimensions. By combining these techniques, the model achieves superior performance in terms of image quality compared to traditional autoencoder-based methods.
